.N\+ET Remoting, in the old days, was .N\+E\+T’s response to Java R\+MI, and basically was a remote references implementation, similar to C\+O\+R\+BA. With Remoting, one can call methods on an object that resides in a different machine. .N\+ET Remoting has long since been superseded by W\+CF, but it is still a viable alternative, particularly because W\+CF does not allow remote references.
