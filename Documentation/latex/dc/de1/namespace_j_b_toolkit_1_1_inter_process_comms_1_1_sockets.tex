\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_j_b_toolkit_1_1_windows}{Windows}} does not support the A\+F\+\_\+\+U\+N\+IX family of sockets, only T\+C\+P/\+IP, so, for demonstrating IP network communication I could have chosen either T\+CP or U\+DP, but I went for U\+DP because of the better performance and because of the relative simplicity that this example required.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_j_b_toolkit_1_1_windows}{Windows}} does not support the A\+F\+\_\+\+U\+N\+IX family of sockets, only T\+C\+P/\+IP, so, for demonstrating IP network communication I could have chosen either T\+CP or U\+DP, but I went for U\+DP because of the better performance and because of the relative simplicity that this example required. 

It leverages the Udp\+Client class to send byte-\/array messages, because this class hides some of the complexity of Socket, making it easier to use. As a side note, it is even possible to use W\+CF with a U\+DP transport (binding).

Because the Receive method blocks until there is some contents to receive, we need to spawn a thread to avoid blocking.
