JBToolkit.CSV.Native.CSVHelper \- Convert \fBCSV\fP from and to a DataTable\&. This class doesn't require any third party packages to use which can sometimes be useful, however it may not account for every single permutation of a \fBCSV\fP file, ony basic\&. This class does however support strings wrapped in 'Speachmarks' quite nicely, whic quite a lot of \fBCSV\fP to DataTable implementations don't seem to get right\&.
